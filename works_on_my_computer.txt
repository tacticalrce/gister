Hi CS6903 Project 2 Grader! :)

If you're reading this, you'd like to know what our development environment is.

Well, it's pretty easy. We dev'd and tested both on Windows (7, 64-bit) and Ubuntu (Kali Linux 2.0 64-bit) without issues.

We only used python (dev'd and tested with Python 2.7.10 ; we don't fuss around with 3.0 shenanigans).

Regarding dependencies, it's fairly easy:
* Basic internet connection (need SSL access to API.GITHUB.com)
* Python pip (default)
  - On Windows: c:\python27\scripts\pip.exe install <package_name>
  - On Ubuntu:  pip install <package_name>
* Use pip to install 3 packages:
  - pyaes
  - requests
  - pyqrcode

Once you have that working, you can use the scripts pretty easily.
* Come up with a pre-shared passcode (10 char minimum)
* Run gister_transmit.py with one argument: the file you're trying to transfer
* Once that's finished, it *should* pop up your default web browser with the Gist ID and Message Salt
  - If you don't have a browser installed (weird), then the log messages will show you this data
    - "Generated Salt:" -> Message Salt
    - "GIST ID:" -> Gist Message ID
* Run the gister_receive.py script with those two parameters
  - gister_receive.py <gist_id> <message salt>
* It will write the file to your current working directory with the date/time file stamp as the name


If you're feeling bored, you can also run our test suite. It takes ~45 minutes, and exercises all components.
Just execute "tester.py" and it will log everything to the screen.


Feel free to let us know (adp360@nyu.edu ; njr5@nyu.edu) in case you have any issues.
We tested it ourselves on 2 systems each, and had a few friends give it a shot without any issues using the above directions.
If anything goes wrong, it's absolutely unexpected and we feel confident we can run it down.

Thanks!
